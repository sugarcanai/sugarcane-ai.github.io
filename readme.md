### Focused Development 🤝
Microservices allow developers to concentrate on specific AI application components, ensuring clean and modular code. Each service has a clear task, simplifying development and scalability.

### Boosted Collaboration 🤝
Microservices foster collaboration among development teams. Separate teams can work on different services concurrently, accelerating development and innovation for top-notch AI apps.

### Decoupled Flexibility 🔄
In microservices, prompts, data, and the application layer are decoupled, providing flexibility. Developers can fine-tune LLMs, manage prompts, and handle data independently, enabling rapid experimentation and innovation.

### Robust Reliability, Scalability, and Maintenance 📈
Microservices offer improved reliability, effortless scalability, and streamlined maintenance, ensuring consistent AI app performance without disruptions, regardless of app size, while allowing efficient updates and bug fixes.
